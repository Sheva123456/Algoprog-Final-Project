# Algoprog-Final-Project
My Algoprog final project is a ryhtym game called Friday Night Fightin'
In order to run it, python and pygame must be installed. 

HOW TO PLAY
- The keybinds are 'q', 'w', 'a', 's'  which are bound to the blue note, red note, purple note, and white note respectively.
  
- In order to win, you must chip down the opponent's health by timing the red and blue notes (w and q) ( which are on the top half of the note section ). Long notes require you to spam the right button. (missing these notes won't damage your healthbar)

- However, even if timed perfectly, there is a randomizer that dictates whether or not the opponent will block or get damaged. The higher the accuracy, the higher the chance of hitting.

- The purple and white notes (a and s) are block buttons. If timed incorrectly, your healthbar will be chipped.

- If the timer runs out and the opponent is still alive, you lose.
